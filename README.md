# Global-thresholding-on-pre-GLOF-NDWI-images
Applying Tiled-thresholding for detection of Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) in Pakistan from Sentinel-2 based NDWI index.
Tilling the images is implemented in order to identify the subtiles that provide the more clear separation between land and water. The statistics of these subtiles are then considered to determine the correct thresholds using Otzu or Kittler-Illingworth thresholding techniques.
