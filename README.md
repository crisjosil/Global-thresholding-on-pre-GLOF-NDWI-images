# Global-thresholding-on-pre-GLOF-NDWI-images
Applying Tiled-thresholding for detection of Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) in Pakistan from Sentinel-2 based NDWI index.
- A large image normally contains complex statistics make more the selection of appropiate thredholds.
- To address this, a large image can divided into subtiles and a procedure can be followed to identify the subtiles that provide the more clear separation between classes, in this case, land and water. 
- The statistics of these subtiles are then considered to determine the correct thresholds using Otzu or Kittler-Illingworth thresholding techniques.
